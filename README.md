Speech Emotion Recognition using TESS Dataset
This project implements Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using the TESS dataset in Python. SER is the task of classifying the emotional state of a speaker from their speech signal. The TESS dataset consists of speech recordings labeled with seven different emotions: neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and surprised.

The project utilizes various machine learning techniques and libraries to build a model that can accurately predict the emotional state based on the input speech. The steps involved in this project include data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset
The TESS dataset is a publicly available dataset for SER. It contains 2,535 speech recordings from 200 actors (half male and half female) and covers seven different emotions. The dataset is available for download from the following source: TESS Dataset.

To use the dataset, download and extract it into the project directory. The dataset should be organized into folders corresponding to each emotion.
